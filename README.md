Tutorial: How to Create a Hardware Spoofer in C++

In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to create a simple hardware spoofer that can change identifiers such as the MAC address, disk serial number, BIOS serial, and CPU ID on a Windows machine. We will also provide explanations for each section of the code so you can understand what is happening behind the scenes.

-----------------



Prerequisites:
Basic understanding of C++.
Administrator privileges: This tutorial involves modifying system settings that require administrator access.
Step 1: Setting up the project
Before we start coding, make sure you have a C++ development environment set up. I recommend using Visual Studio or Code::Blocks for this tutorial. Make sure you run your compiler as an administrator to have the required permissions.

Step 2: Initializing the Project
Create a new C++ project and name it something like "HardwareSpoofer". Open the main .cpp file, where you will write the code for our spoofer.

Step 3: Writing the Code
We’ll be dividing the code into several functions. Each function is responsible for spoofing a different hardware identifier.

1. Checking Administrator Privileges
Before modifying system hardware identifiers, we need to check if the program is being run with administrator privileges. Without admin rights, our changes won’t work.

-----------------

cpp

// Function to check if the program is running with admin privileges
bool isAdmin() {
    BOOL isAdmin = FALSE;
    PSID administratorsGroup = NULL;

    SID_IDENTIFIER_AUTHORITY NtAuthority = SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY;
    if (AllocateAndInitializeSid(&NtAuthority, 2, SECURITY_BUILTIN_DOMAIN_RID, DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_ADMINS, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &administratorsGroup)) {
        CheckTokenMembership(NULL, administratorsGroup, &isAdmin);
        FreeSid(administratorsGroup);
    }
    return isAdmin != FALSE;
}
Explanation:
The function checks if the current user has administrative rights by querying the system's security token.

AllocateAndInitializeSid initializes the SID (Security Identifier) for the administrators group.
If the function returns TRUE, we know the user has administrator rights.
2. Generating Random Serial Numbers
Now, let's create a helper function to generate random serial numbers for the MAC address, disk serial, BIOS serial, and CPU ID. This helps us avoid using static values and adds some randomness to each spoof.

cpp

// Function to generate a random serial number
std::string generateRandomSerial(int length) {
    const char alphanum[] = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> dist(0, sizeof(alphanum) - 2);

    std::string serial;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        serial += alphanum[dist(gen)];
    }
    return serial;
}
Explanation:
This function uses the C++ standard library's random number generation to create a random string.

We use std::random_device to seed the random number generator and std::uniform_int_distribution to ensure the output is within the range of acceptable characters.
3. Spoofing the MAC Address
Next, we’ll spoof the MAC address of the network adapter. The MAC address is a hardware identifier assigned to the network card. Spoofing it can hide the real device information.

cpp

// Function to spoof MAC address
bool spoofMACAddress(const std::string& adapterName, const std::string& newMAC) {
    std::string key = "SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}";
    HKEY hKey;

    if (RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, key.c_str(), 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &hKey) != ERROR_SUCCESS) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open registry key.\n";
        return false;
    }

    DWORD index = 0;
    char name[256];
    DWORD nameSize = sizeof(name);
    while (RegEnumKeyEx(hKey, index++, name, &nameSize, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
        HKEY subKey;
        if (RegOpenKeyEx(hKey, name, 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &subKey) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
            DWORD len = 0;
            if (RegQueryValueEx(subKey, "DriverDesc", nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, &len) == ERROR_SUCCESS && len > 0) {
                std::string driverDesc(len, '\0');
                if (RegQueryValueEx(subKey, "DriverDesc", nullptr, nullptr, reinterpret_cast<BYTE*>(&driverDesc[0]), &len) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
                    if (driverDesc.find(adapterName) != std::string::npos) {
                        if (RegSetValueEx(subKey, "NetworkAddress", 0, REG_SZ, reinterpret_cast<const BYTE*>(newMAC.c_str()), newMAC.size()) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
                            RegCloseKey(subKey);
                            RegCloseKey(hKey);
                            return true;
                        } else {
                            std::cerr << "Failed to set new MAC address.\n";
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            RegCloseKey(subKey);
        }
        nameSize = sizeof(name);
    }
    RegCloseKey(hKey);
    return false;
}
Explanation:
This function accesses the Windows registry to change the MAC address of a network adapter.

We use RegOpenKeyEx and RegQueryValueEx to find the network adapter and modify the MAC address.
The key "NetworkAddress" is where the MAC address is stored, and we modify its value with the new MAC.
4. Spoofing the Disk Serial Number
The disk serial number is another hardware identifier that can be changed to hide the actual hardware information. We'll use the wmic command to spoof it.

cpp

// Function to spoof disk serial number using WMIC
bool spoofDiskSerial(const std::string& drive, const std::string& newSerial) {
    std::string command = "vol " + drive + " && echo Y | wmic diskdrive where deviceid=\"" + drive + "\" set SerialNumber=\"" + newSerial + "\"";
    return (system(command.c_str()) == 0);
}
Explanation:
This function uses the wmic command to change the disk serial number of a specific drive.

We build the command using the drive letter and the new serial number, then execute it via the system() function.
5. Spoofing BIOS Serial Number Using AMIDEWIN
AMIDEWIN is a tool that can modify the BIOS serial number. This step may vary depending on your BIOS and motherboard, and the tool must be available in your project folder.

cpp

// Function to spoof BIOS serial number using AMIDEWIN
bool spoofBIOSSerial(const std::string& newSerial) {
    std::string command = "AMIDEWIN.exe /S:BIOS /SNR:" + newSerial;
    return (system(command.c_str()) == 0);
}
Explanation:
This function uses the AMIDEWIN.exe tool to change the BIOS serial number.

The /S:BIOS /SNR: parameters tell AMIDEWIN to change the serial number stored in the BIOS.
6. Main Function to Run the Spoofer
Finally, we need a main() function to tie everything together. This is where we check for admin rights, generate random serial numbers, and call the functions to spoof hardware identifiers.

cpp

int main() {
    if (!isAdmin()) {
        std::cerr << "You need to run this program as Administrator.\n";
        return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "Starting spoofing process...\n";

    // Generate random serials for spoofing
    std::string randomMAC = generateRandomSerial(12);
    std::string randomSerial = generateRandomSerial(8);
    std::string randomBIOS = generateRandomSerial(12);

    std::cout << "Generated Random MAC: " << randomMAC << "\n";
    std::cout << "Generated Random Serial: " << randomSerial << "\n";
    std::cout << "Generated Random BIOS Serial: " << randomBIOS << "\n";

    // Spoofing the hardware identifiers
    if (spoofMACAddress("Ethernet", randomMAC)) {
        std::cout << "MAC Address spoofed successfully!\n";
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to spoof MAC Address.\n";
    }

    if (spoofDiskSerial("C:", randomSerial)) {
        std::cout << "Disk Serial spoofed successfully!\n";
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to spoof Disk Serial.\n";
    }

    if (spoofBIOSSerial(randomBIOS)) {
        std::cout << "BIOS Serial spoofed successfully!\n";
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to spoof BIOS Serial.\n";
    }

    std::cout << "Spoofing process completed.\n";
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The main() function checks if the program is run as an administrator.

It generates random serials for each hardware identifier and attempts to spoof them.
If the spoofing is successful, it prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message.
Conclusion
This tutorial provided a step-by-step guide to creating a hardware spoofer in C++. You learned how to:

Check if the program is running with admin rights.
Generate random serial numbers.
Spoof MAC address, disk serial, and BIOS serial using Windows APIs and command-line tools.
Note: Be cautious when using spoofing tools, as it can lead to unexpected system behavior. Always use these tools in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine.

C++:

The majority of the code is written in C++, which is used for creating the hardware spoofer program.
C++ is used for creating the application, handling system commands, interacting with the Windows registry, and generating random serial numbers.
Windows Batch Scripting:

For spoofing disk serial numbers and using the wmic command, Windows batch scripting is involved. The batch commands are executed using the system() function in C++ to invoke command-line tools like wmic.
Command Line Utilities:

The use of AMIDEWIN (a command-line tool) to spoof the BIOS serial number is also required. AMIDEWIN is a third-party tool, not a programming language, but it requires understanding of how to interact with it using command-line arguments.
Summary of Tools/Technologies:
C++ (Main language)
Windows Command Line (for wmic and batch commands)
AMIDEWIN (Third-party utility for BIOS spoofing)
To compile and run this C++ code, you'll need a C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, GCC) and administrative privileges on a Windows machine.
